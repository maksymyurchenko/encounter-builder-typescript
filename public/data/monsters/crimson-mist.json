While doing so, it can enter a Medium or smaller creature’s space. When the mist enters a creature’s space, the creature must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a successful save, the creature can choose to be pushed 5 feet back or to the side of the mist. A creature that chooses not to be pushed suffers the consequences of a failed saving throw.\n\nOn a failed save, the mist enters the creature’s space, and the creature takes 15 (4d6) necrotic damage and is engulfed. The engulfed creature can’t breathe, is restrained, and takes 15 (4d6) necrotic damage at the start of each of the mist’s turns. When the mist moves, the engulfed creature doesn’t move with it, and is freed. An engulfed creature can try to escape by taking an action to make a DC 14 Strength check. On a success, the creature escapes and enters a space of its choice within 5 feet of the mist. A creature within 5 feet of the mist can take an action to pull a creature out of the mist.

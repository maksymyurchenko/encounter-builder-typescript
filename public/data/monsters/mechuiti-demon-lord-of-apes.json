The target must succeed on a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw or take 28 (8d6) fire damage.\n\n- The whole volcano trembles and shakes. Each creature on a solid surface other than a demon must succeed on a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone. All ground in the volcano becomes difficult terrain for creatures other than a demon until initiative count 20 on the next round.\n\n- Volcanic gases form a cloud in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point Mechuiti can see within 120 feet of it.

Any creature that drinks the water must make a successful DC 15 Constitution saving throw against disease or be infected. An infected creature is poisoned until the disease is cured. Every 24 hours that elapse, the target must repeat the saving throw. On a failure, its hit point maximum is reduced by 5 (2d4). The disease is cured on a success.

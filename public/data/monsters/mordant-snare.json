Unlike normal zombies, any creature within 5 feet of a mordant puppet when the puppet takes piercing or slashing damage takes 3 (1d6) acid damage (spray from the wound). All puppets attached to a particular tentacle are destroyed if the mordant snare attacks with that tentacle; this does 9 (2d8) acid damage per puppet to all creatures within 5 feet of any of those puppets, or half damage with a successful DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. Damage done to puppet zombies doesn't affect the mordant snare. If the snare is killed, all of its puppets die immediately without causing any acid damage."}],"spell_list":[],"img_main":null,"document__slug":"tob","document__title":"Tome of Beasts OGL","document__license_url":"http://open5e.com/legal","id":"mordant-snare","type":"aberration"}

After each long rest, the creature must repeat the saving throw. If it fails, the victim takes 1d3 Dexterity damage and is paralyzed for 24 hours; if the saving throw succeeds, the creature takes no damage and feels well enough to act normally for the day. This continues until the creature dies from Dexterity loss, recovers naturally by making successful saving throws after two consecutive long rests, or is cured with lesser restoration or comparable magic. After the disease ends, the victim recovers 1d3 lost Dexterity with each long rest; greater restoration or comparable magic can restore it all at once."}],"reactions":"","legendary_desc":"","legendary_actions":"","special_abilities":"","spell_list":[],"img_main":null,"document__slug":"tob","document__title":"Tome of Beasts OGL","document__license_url":"http://open5e.com/legal","id":"rust-drake","type":"dragon"}

A creature must be charmed, grappled, or incapacitated to be kissed. A kiss hits automatically, does 21 (6d6) necrotic damage, and fills the mirager with an exultant rush of euphoria that has the same effect as a heroism spell lasting 1 minute.

Any creature that approaches within 120 feet of the terrain must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. Those that fail are affected as by the enthrall spell with the mirager as the caster; they give the mirage their undivided attention, wanting only to explore it, marvel at its beauty, and rest there for an hour. The mirager can choose to have creatures focus their attention on it instead of the hallucinatory terrain. Creatures affected by the enthrall effect automatically fail saving throws to disbelieve the hallucinatory terrain. This effect ends if the hallucinatory terrain is dispelled."}],"img_main":null,"document__slug":"tob","document__title":"Tome of Beasts OGL","document__license_url":"http://open5e.com/legal","id":"mirager","type":"fey"}

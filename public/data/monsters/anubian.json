The storm moves with the anubian. The area is heavily obscured, and each creature other than an anubian that enters the sandstorm or ends its turn there must make a successful DC 13 Strength saving throw or be restrained by it. Also, each creature other than an anubian that ends its turn inside the sandstorm takes 3 (1d6) slashing damage. The anubian can maintain the haboob for up to 10 minutes as if concentrating on a spell. While maintaining the haboob, the anubian's speed is reduced to 5 feet and it can't sand step. Creatures restrained by the sandstorm move with the anubian. A creature can free itself or an adjacent creature from the sandstorm by using its action and making a DC 13 Strength check. A successful check ends the restraint on the target creature."}],"reactions":"","legendary_desc":"","legendary_actions":"","special_abilities":[{"name":"Sand Stealth","desc":"The anubian gains an additional +2 (+7 in total) to Stealth in sand terrain"},{"name":"Sand Step","desc":"Instead of moving, the anubian's humanoid form collapses into loose sand and immediately reforms at another unoccupied space within 10 feet.

A successful save renders the target immune to the koralk's poison for 24 hours. If a creature dies while poisoned by a koralk, its body bursts open, spewing vile liquid and a newly-formed lemure devil. The lemure is under the command of any higher-order devil nearby. The poison can be neutralized by lesser restoration, protection from poison, or comparable magic. If the lemure is killed, the original creature can be restored to life by resurrection or comparable magic.","attack_bonus":7,"damage_dice":"2d8"}],"reactions":"","legendary_desc":"","legendary_actions":"","special_abilities":[{"name":"Devil's Sight","desc":"Magical darkness does not impair the koralk's darkvision."},{"name":"Magic Resistance","desc":"The koralk has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects."},{"name":"Steadfast","desc":"The koralk cannot be frightened while it can see an allied creature within 30 feet of it"}],"img_main":null,"document__slug":"tob","document__title":"Tome of Beasts OGL","document__license_url":"http://open5e.com/legal","id":"koralk-harvester-devil","type":"fiend"}

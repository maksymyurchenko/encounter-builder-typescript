All devils have advantage on spell attacks made against the devil.marked creature, and the creature has disadvantage on saving throws made against spells and abilities used by devils. The mark can be removed by remove curse if the caster also makes a successful DC 23 spellcasting check. The mark reveals itself as desecrated to detect evil and good. It often shifts its position on the body, especially when it's concealed (and usually at the most inconvenient moment). Because such marks are sometimes placed on those who've made pacts with devils, NPC paladins and clerics might assume that any character bearing a devil's mark is in league with evil forces."},{"name":"Cast a Spell (Costs 3 Actions)","desc":"Totivillus casts a spell from its list of prepared spells, using a spell slot as normal."}],"special_abilities":[{"name":"Devil's Sight","desc":"Magical darkness doesn't impede the devil's darkvision."},{"name":"Fear Aura","desc":"Any creature hostile to Totivillus that starts its turn within 20 feet of him must make a DC 21 Wisdom saving throw, unless Totivillus is incapacitated.
